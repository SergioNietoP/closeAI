Just playing with AI...

19/06 Today I started playing with Whisper, the speech-to-text algorithm from OpenAI. 

I started asking for the transcription of a poor quality .mp3 audio . It has a duration of 1:18 minutes.

Cost: 0.05$

Code ->

```
import openai

# Set the API key
openai.api_key = "API-KEY"

# Open the audio file and transcribe it
with open("path-audio.mp3", "rb") as audio_file:
    transcript = openai.Audio.transcribe(
        file = audio_file,
        model = "whisper-1",
        response_format="text"
    )

# Print the transcript
print(transcript)
```
